<!-- Plugin description -->

# !! Deprecation warning !!
I'm not interested in developing `InLine` and using `IntelliJ IDEA` anymore since JetBrains dropped support for [Free Rust Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182--deprecated-rust) 
and started focusing on `new UI` that is IMO ugly. I don't like the direction this IDE is going and decided to switch away.

You should consider using alternative plugins:
* [Inspection Lens](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19678-inspection-lens)
* [Inline Problems](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20789-inlineproblems)

You can consider using alternative IDE:
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - feature & plugin Rich IDE with not great UI (By Microsoft).
* [Lapce](https://lapce.dev/) - Middleground between VIM & VSCode with fast user-friendly UI similar to __old__ `IntelliJ IDEA` UI, modal editing and built-in LSP & Inline errors. Lacks certain features, __But is written in Rust__ so you can contribute.

### InLine is highly customizable plugin that shows errors and hints inline. 
#### Also supports gutter icons, colorful background and special effects.

<kbd>Settings</kbd> > <kbd>Appearance & Behaviour</kbd> > <kbd>âš™ InLine</kbd>

### Shortcuts:
* Hide/Show all errors __alt K__
* Change text style (After/Underline) __alt L__

### In plugin settings you can:
* Show or hide specific __level of errors__ - _error, warning, weak warning, information_
* Change __text colors & text visibility__ for each error level
* Change __text style__ to make it appear _after line end_ or _under line_
* Change __background colors__ & __background visibility__ for each error level
* Change __gutter icons visibility__ for each error level and select number of gutter icons
* Apply additional effect
* Change font of the hints

### Choices

There are already multiple plugins like this inspired by VSCode ErrorLens extension - check <kbd>Inspired by</kbd> section.
I've decided to make my own because I want to have some extra features for code __writing and demonstration__ purposes such as:
* Fill __background of whole line__
* Show __error icons__ in gutter area for different kinds of errors
* Turn __hint text off__ but make __background stay__

### Future

In the future I am planning to add more customization such as:
* New effects
* Error description changing
* Additional ways to filter errors
