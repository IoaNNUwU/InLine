<!-- Plugin description -->
 __InLine is highly customizable plugin that shows errors and hints inline.__\
 __It also can show gutter icons, colorful background and special effects.__

Errors are filtered on the line by priority
<kbd>Settings</kbd> > <kbd>Appearance & Behaviour</kbd> > <kbd>âš™ InLine</kbd>
### In plugin settings you can:
* Show or hide specific __level of errors__
* Change __text colors & text visibility__ for each error level
* Change __background colors & background visibility__ for each error level
* Change __gutter icons visibility__ for each error level
* Apply additional effect
* Ignore some errors by description

### Inspired by
* [Inspection Lens](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19678-inspection-lens) - Plugin I've used before.
It lacks customization and features
* [Inline Problems](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20789-inlineproblems) - Amazing plugin I stole box effect idea from.

### Decisions

There are already multiple plugins like this inspired by VSCode ErrorLens extension - check <kbd>Inspired by</kbd> section.
I've decided to make my own because I want to have some extra features for code __writing and demonstration__ purposes such as:
* Fill __background of whole line__
* Show __error icons__ in gutter area for different kinds of errors
* Turn __hint text off__ but make __background stay__

### Future

In the future I am planning to add more customization such as:
* New effects
* Error description changing
* Additional ways to filter errors
