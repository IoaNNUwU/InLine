### Inspired by
* [Inspection Lens](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19678-inspection-lens) - Plugin I've used before.
It lacks customization and features
* [Inline Problems](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20789-inlineproblems) - Amazing plugin I stole box effect idea from.

### Decisions

There are already multiple plugins like this inspired by VSCode ErrorLens extension - check <kbd>Inspired by</kbd> section.
I've decided to make my own because I want to have some extra features for code __writing and demonstration__ purposes such as:
* Fill __background of whole line__
* Show __error icons__ in gutter area for different kinds of errors
* Turn __hint text off__ but make __background stay__

### Future

In the future I am planning to add more customization such as:
* New effects
* Error description changing
* Additional ways to filter errors
